# Time Series Clustering

## Step - 1: Comparitive study of various clustering algorithms
 * Base Python File : TS_Cluster.ipynb
 * Algorithms implemented : K-Means, Affinity Propogation, Mean Shift (Others to be implemented)
 * Performance of algorithms : Performance.csv
 * Other things to work here : Better Visualization, Customized distance metric
 
## Step - 2: Study on best performing algorithms
 * Study algorithms which perform better and do EDA
 * Figure out methods to improve performance of shortlisted algorithms

## Step - 3: Implement algorithm based on all the learnings
